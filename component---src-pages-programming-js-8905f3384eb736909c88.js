To create this, footage of the EPG was analysed in great detail to ascertain how the music should be played and where. The first version of this program used colour detection from a displayed capture feed of the STB's output. Several pixels were analysed to detect wheter the EPG was active. Legacy Sky STBs have RS-232 ports that are intended to transmit information to the Sky Gnome device. The second revision (Mk2) uses this protocol to quickly and reliably unmute the played music.
