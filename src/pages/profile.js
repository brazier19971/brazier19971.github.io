  <p>Maximising opportunities, being bold, always learning. These are the three main principles that define how I approach life. I’m never afraid to step up to a new challenge, and I prefer to approach large, complex situations by breaking them down into smaller sub-tasks. When things don’t go as expected, I take the time to think about what can be done to improve the situation, instead of shying away and waiting for someone else to sort it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I strongly appreciate and value the importance of teamwork, and I firmly believe that many minds working together is greater than one. Forming constructive relationships between individuals is of key importance of any team that I work in, which helps to facilitate effective communication, and to strengthen the team as a whole. Enhancing my leadership skills is something I am keen to do. I was recognised with the ‘Governors' prize for leadership in the Sixth Form’ in 2019 as part of my Sixth Form enrichment programme.</p>

 <p>Notably, at present, in addition to being a full-time student, I also work as a shift supervisor at a local convenience store. This was one of the boldest decisions I have taken in my career so far. Being one of the society’s youngest supervisors, starting the role at 20, it certainly was a move that carried risk. However, I have thoroughly enjoyed the additional responsibility. Leading the team effectively is of crucial importance to the store’s operation. </p>

 <p>I’ve never been afraid to stand out, and throw myself straight into the deep end. One example of such an event in my life is working my way up to become a shift supervisor at a food retail store at the age of 20. Being one of the society’s youngest supervisors, this was a move that carried a significant amount of risk. I worked my up to the position after being a general assistant in the store for three years, and have thoroughly enjoyed the additional responsibilities, including being responsible for the safety of the store and staff that I work with. </p>    
 <p></p>      
 <p>Outside of work, I currently am a full-time student at Anglia Ruskin University, attending the Cambridge campus, studying BEng (Hons) Computer Science, and currently are performing at a 90% grade average.  Having the opportunity to study this course has deepened an already present interest into technology and computing as a whole. This particular course has provided me with a view of the industry from a myriad of different perspectives, particularly within C# programming and Cisco-based networking, both of which I frequently practice outside of the course. I maintain a small ‘home lab’ of commercial-grade Cisco networking equipment simply for the purpose of experimentation. </p>

 <p>Computing has always been a core interest of mine, and I enjoy utilising and keeping up with the latest developments in the field. Whether it’s new hardware, or a routine software update, I’m always keen to check out what’s new, and how the changes could benefit different users. Interacting with and providing feedback for the latest beta software is thoroughly enjoyable. I am a beta tester of the Microsoft Windows, Apple iOS, watchOS and macOS platforms. The area of computer hardware is also a keen interest of mine throughout my life, having built my first computer at the age of ten. </p>

 <p>As aforementioned, I have a deep interest in computing and technology, and I enjoy using and keeping up with the developments in the field. Whether it’s new hardware, or a routine software update, I am always keen to look at what’s new. Interacting with and providing feedback for the latest beta software is thoroughly enjoyable to myself, and I am a registered beta tester of the Microsoft Windows, Apple iOS, watchOS and macOS platforms.</p>

 <p>One particular interest I have stems from the earliest years of my childhood, and that is broadcast technology. In around 2004, our family had our first digital satellite video recorder installed, and I remember watching the engineer pausing the TV show right in front of me. Four-year-old me was completely mesmerised by this ‘magic’ as I used to call it. I spent many hours staring at the demonstration channel trying to figure out how it all worked. Nowadays, I maintain this interest, with the key advantage of knowing that it isn’t ‘magic’. Recently, I have begun to learn the fundamentals of DVB-S and its underlying principles, and one of my spare-time projects involves utilising the serial ports on a range of satellite receivers to simulate previously discontinued functionality related to an audio service integrated into its electronic programming guide (EPG).</p>
